# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns placing X and O on a 3×3 grid. The game is built using:

HTML to create the game structure and grid layout.

CSS to style the board, highlight winning moves, and provide a clean user interface.

JavaScript to handle game logic:

Switching turns

Checking for winners or draws

Displaying messages (e.g., "Player X wins!")

Features:

Interactive game board

Win/draw detection

Restart button to play again

It’s a great beginner project to practice DOM manipulation and game logic in JavaScript.
